# Vehicle Management App

A secure, scalable vehicle management application built with a **Flutter frontend** and a **Go backend**. This app allows users to search for car owners using plate numbers, communicate with them via phone or email, and ensures security through mandatory login and contact info updates. Itâ€™s optimized for big data (tested with 1M+ rows) and tracks search history for security purposes.

## Features

- **Fast Search**: Quickly search for car owners by plate number, even with large datasets (1M+ rows), thanks to Redis caching and efficient database queries.
- **Secure Login**: Users must log in with their national number and a specific key, ensuring only authorized access.
- **Mandatory Contact Info**: After login, users without an email or phone number are prompted to add them, enhancing communication and security.
- **Government Integration**: Cars are linked to users via national numbers, simulating a government-connected database.
- **Communication**: Contact car owners via phone or email directly from the app.
- **Search History Tracking**: Silently saves search history (user ID, searched user, time, and count) for security auditing, without notifying the user.
- **Big Data Ready**: Tested with 1M randomly generated rows using Go scripts, ensuring scalability.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (Dart) - Cross-platform UI for Android, iOS, and Web.
- **Backend**: Go (Gin framework) - High-performance server with RESTful APIs.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL - Stores users, cars, and search history.
- **Caching**: Redis - Speeds up searches with in-memory caching.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) - Secures API endpoints.
- **ORM**: GORM - Simplifies database interactions in Go.
